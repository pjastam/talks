## Crash course risicoverevening

In this talk, we ended the section on the goal of risk equalization with a flow diagram connecting competition -> regulation -> incentives -> behavior -> effects. You can watch an interactive version of this flow chart in 6 slides [in English](https://pst.am/goal-risk-equalization/) or [in Dutch](https://pst.am/doel-risicoverevening).

## Risk equalization app

You can find the risk equalization app [here](http://www.risicoverevening.nl). Just play around to get the hang of it.
