## Introduction

The goal of risk equalization was explicitly described in detail in the Dutch Health Insurance Act (2006) about [here](https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stb-2005-389.html#IDA5LXXB). It is interesting to read and may differ slightly from how it was described in my talk.

Surprisingly, despite a long history of developing a very sophisticated risk equalization model, currently there is much discussion about the goal of risk equalization in the Netherlands. We summarize this debate in @van_de_ven_goal_2022 and propose a way out of this controversy.

Furthermore note that some people have high expectations about solving economic problems in health insurance and health care by risk equalization. To put these expectations into context, @stam_risicoverevening_2015 wrote that risk equalization is not a panacea.

All in all, given these debates, it is important to get a better understanding of risk equalization in order to be able to judge what's right and what's wrong. 

## Slides

The slides of the lecture are not included here, they are on the blackboard of your university.

## Resources

In this talk, we ended the section on the goal of risk equalization with a flow diagram connecting competition -> regulation -> incentives -> behavior -> effects. You can watch an interactive summary of the goal of risk equalizartion in 6 slides in [English](https://pst.am/goal-risk-equalization/) or [in Dutch](https://pst.am/doel-risicoverevening).

## Risk equalization app

You can find the risk equalization app [here](http://www.risicoverevening.nl). Just play around to get the hang of it.
